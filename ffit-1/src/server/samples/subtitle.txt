overcoming Vim phobia uh when I learnedVim I actually had Vim fomo I had suchphobia or fomo of missing out on vim andmine was right around 2012 when Istarted learning Vim anyways heha herewe go I've been coding for almost adecade now and for anyone who spendstwo-thirds of his day doing uh doing sohis tool chains matters let's go for awalk down memory lane this article isgoing to be different disclaimer today'scontent is going to be subjective okay Ilike I like subjective content I wasdabbling in notepad Plus+ I actually didtry to notepad++ for well over 10minutes and then realized ain't no wayI'm going to be using notepad++ to learnJava development as a young cluelesspotato in my school they forced us touse blue jay blue jay to learn Java uhat that moment I didn't even understandwhat an editor was to me it seemed likenotepad with extra buttons yep Fair okaythis is completely Fair the focus was onlearning program not DX developerexperience the only intriguing thing Iuh was that I could run code using aplugin by pressing one of the functionkeys it uh it gave me a big advantageover writing and notepad and runningWindows command prompt absolutely didsomeone just say they make their livingusing notepad++ I made a living withnotepad Plus+ for almost two years thatis insane you are crazy you are crazykey points it's good to have a place uhto write and execute code together okayfair two years later Eclipse oh oh ohthe the poorman why would you want to do this Icould decently code in a couplelanguages now one of uh one of the booksI was reading recom the next shiny thingeclipse eclipse had hit quite the rightspot for the first time the tool chainwas becoming addictive the joy of codingbuilding and running those Java Swingapps without diving into the build andexecution system was simply M yeah I doagree there was something very beautifulabout having everything just build withnet beans the superior Java experiencenet beans okay net beans the internetwas not big so I often would go throughoffline docs and figure out figure myway out out I got let's see it gottedious at times but there wasn'tanother way out uh for the first time Iwondered oh why this software didn'tbehave like the previous one uh no Ididn't know the word IDE yet I only knewthat Java runs on three billion devicesit had to be good and I had to be goodat it this is a fair take hate is astrong word I hate Java also fair typeone in the chat if you have neverprogrammed Java and you hate Java wowall right all right all right all rightkey points it's better if your softwarecan handle the configuration work foryou it's even better if the software ifyour software can tell you what to writenext fair uh meeting Linux in VI Linux Ialso run a pizza a piece of bread fromlast week wait run I also run on a pieceof bread from last week fair windowsyour CPU is not of the latest generationplease click here to find out moreinformation this is pretty good this ispretty good pretty good meme right thereI got this new blue laptop the stickersays Ubuntu it do you guys say Ubuntu orUbuntu I like to say uu see mepersonally I'm kind of on a I'm kind ofon a different train a little bit Idon't know if you guys know this but I'mmore of the uh I'm more of a fan of theo1 two o o anyways uh I'm not sure wherethat was going let's see let's see whatthe heck is this thing where is my DVDwith pirated Windows an activation keywritten on the back of it I went toschool library and boy that book on Unixgave me Tremors of Joy I decided toshift to Linux PermanI never uh and I've never touchedWindows ever since based based basedbased based uh same here same thinghappened here it's pronounced as Archit's Arch I couldn't understand whyweirdos on the internet always suggestedediting random config files usingsomething calledVI uh who on God's uh Green Earth wouldopen up the terminal navigate to a fileenter into this creepy uh VI thing whereone can't even quit this was literallymy mentality 2010 this was my mental2010 I kid you not I use Vim full timenow this was my mentality completelyisn't it funny how thatworks uh sadly it was part of thecollege curriculum and I had to write init the good thing is is that after youpress I VI becomes normal I hated it sobad that I wrote a g at a config so myprofessor thought I was coding in theterminal what a great Professor let's goProfessor let's go great professoruh something about writing a g configedit or G config just to do that alsogreat teaching you to get around it Ican appreciate that key points neverpush for a product SL outcome you maypush for an idea and see if peopleresonate with it every developer shoulduse Linux no exceptions personal take Ialso consider Mac OS a Linux drro I'mjust waiting for chat I'm just waitingforChad chat is in shambles what the hellis this oh man uh all right rightSublime art of coding oh if you hit uhlet's see hits s twice Sublime Text I'monce again asking you forforel you know what the best part aboutthis this meme is is that it actuallyputs programmer humor right here and youknow for a fact that programmer humorSteals and does not ever give theoriginal Source Credit ever shy Ryan cantell you all about it guy you want totell you want to you want to tell themall about it there's a picture of me onon programmer humor and they don't evenknow who I am now things were takenshape I have decided my career path as aweb developer I often build smallutility apps again the book was uh I wasreferring to told me that Sublime is thenext shiny thing oh Hoy I was on Boboard there's something about it thatfeels close to my heart it was Jsonconfiguration I spent the whole week uhtweaking things in the settings file itwas near magical experience of to copy aJon file on a USB drive and make myfriend's machine like mine lowkey dotfiles fair fair I mean I like thatexperience it's a good experience it's agood experience that you can have whatyou want and you can save it to a USBand just make something elseyours I mean we call get now these daysbut I guess you could say it also atthat point my Sublime started to looklike a different application to regularSublime users to this day I am ahardcore ricing fan a fancy term forcustomizing your software and yes I'mimmune to that popup asking me to buySublime just like good old WinRAR therewas somebody in twitch chat whose namewas I actually boughtWinRAR it was it was one of the best itwas one of the best ones ever all rightthe rise of vs code when people ask meto recommend a text editor Visual Studiocode absolutely everyone got on board onthis I spent about I spent aboutprobably three to six months trying tomake Visual Studio code work forme key points missed oh I missed the thekey points okay okay Sublime was fastfor that kind for for the kind of thingsit can do absolutely it's still reallyfast if Sublime was one of the besteditors ever for opening up large filesit was really good uh the only reason itfailed was due to vs code similar pitchcorporate backing and excellentCommunity Support developers moved toVSS code and no uh and no one developsuh tooling around software theypersonally don't use Vim is nowhereclose to sublime's power the almightygue but the community stuck to it and itbecame awesome over timeI I mean I don't know about that lastsentence but whatever key Point numbertwo maybe I disagree with Prime andshambles I'm inshambles let's see I felt like I wasgetting a uh getting ancient and evenstarted working professionally SublimeText was like the back of my hand nowevery key binding and config optionlived in my mind not to mention theplethora of extensions well customizedfor my work flow flow at that pointlosing my Sublime config folder was moreof a worry than the laptop itself justkidding I knew I knew get bythen and yet and yet Mr never usewindows again still calling themfolders absolutely shame just a shame tosee just a shame tosee uh that's actually my my favoriteLinux neck beard shaming is uh actuallyit's directory windows are folders okaythe office was asking to work in vs codeso again there was no option spent amonth tweaking it in the end I wonderedwhat a Frankenstein's monster I had madeit looked like Sublime it responded likeSublime married to vs code and startedheavy like uh my old friend'seclipse the worst part was that uh thesenior guy scolded me every time hetried debugging on my machine usinghacker problems no big deal usual hackerproblems no big deal oh my goodness onething I fell in love about vs code wasuh is its zero config extensionecosystem and it overall felt smartunder the hood while coding I could feelthat it had something uh that Sublimelacked to this day vs code has been myfavorite coding software if somethingcan be coded it will eventually be inVSS code I feel like uh I I feel it isthe modern version of emac what emac isan operatingsystem okay what what is he talkingabout I felt the difference betweenstrict and dynamic type languagesfirsthand I worked on Ruby on Railsthose days and dynamically typedlanguages are a nightmare for any editordon't tell dhh sh shoot me but I hateRuby sh stop it dhh could hear us at anymoment python JavaScript Etc even thoughI coded them daily for one reason uhmaybe for that one reason I knock on thedoors of jet brains from time to timeFair key points vs code had a vision ofbeing an omnipresent editor and thecommunity made it made it happen I knowthe community the really the communityhas the biggest bamboozling that's thebest part is that Microsoft got thecommunity to do so much heavy liftingfor them its core is rigid and wellthought out on top of which people makewhat they want it's a ble let's see itsblessings proves to be its curse sinceanybody can easily write anything peoplewrite them without much thought andlater blame vs code for beingslow well I mean it's also written inJavaScript so there's only so much itcan do you know to be fair JavaScript islike single execution it's not like youcan it's not like it can just magicallybecome multi-threaded uh oops I have abit of perfectionproblem it happens this happens it'sliterally abrowser it's literally a browser what'sthis OCD looking thing uh you ask it's acondition where you are a bit too strictabout how things should be you may saywow that's a good thing but then if yourtable's edges don't match your laptopsand you get a shiver of anxiety that'sdude I used to I swear I used to be soso bad that I would even organize myshirts by likeColors by type I would organizeeverything so much and I remember oneday I was sitting there organizingeverything and I just thought what am Idoing with my life and itcompletely disappeared like it just itjust disappeared from my life from thatmoment I just realized I will never beso concerned about things again likethat like I can't I I emotionally cannothandle the amount of time I spendorganizing themost meaninglessthings and then it just went away itjust went away I even still rememberexactly where I was I was in the Johnthe Johnston uh dormitories in BosemanMontana it was awful I remember justlike spending an entire day justorganizing the stupidest and then Ijust realized I can never do thisagain I can never do this again I nowbuy the samesocks right the same socks every singletime no this was long after my meth daysuh I buy the exact same pair of socks Ido not fold socks I buy the same set ofshirts I have three or four shirtsthat's it they're all the same shirt andI buy black hoodies and I just don'tthink about crap anymore you know howannoying it is to just just spend yourlife doing that also I get distractedfast so I need to F uh focusedenvironment I left this article to getthe above image and now I'm back afterreading about the movie This meme camefrom okay cool we're on the same pagenow see we aren't much different afterall that's pretty good statement I likeboth environments outside and inside thelaptop to be ultra minimal check out thescreenshot at the bottom of the page uhthe there aren't even clo uh close iconson the application Windows if possiblefrom letter spacing and fonts to theinner padding of a popup everything is atrigger to be honest it makes me happyto do this kind of stuff and if yousearch for Unix racing you'll get blownaway on the other hand literally on theother hand I started getting wrist paindue to the constant jumping from lettersand arrows grinding 80 hours a weekcomes with its own perks yeah this isone of thereasons I switched to vorac I wasGoogling about wrist pain conditions andfunnily enough one of the tips was usingVim mode on your computer that sneaky VII couldn't even understand was the samething until I opened it I had some rualresidual hate towards itlet's go for for the for Server work Iwas using Nano later I moved to microwhich was closer to vs code bindingsevery stunt it takes to avoid my archnemesis VI I realized that or stint didI say stunt is it supposed to be stintuh that literally every tool uh I usehas a weird Sublime and vs code hybridkey bindings gosh I hate myself I can'teven use another person's computerrunning pure version of that software tosupport the no terminal mindset set overthe years I forgot all my appreciationfor a said GP Etc things needed tochange I couldn't live in thisdenial this is a great moment this is agreat moment righthere I love where this is slowly comingto you realize that like it's one thingthat I really like is that I can log onto any server and be fairly efficientwith Vim right you just give me Vim longas I can uh long as I can do Globalmarks I'm I'm starting to hop aroundpretty fast on on on projects I don'treally use that often you know or onservers I never use and it's just all asudden you know you start hopping aroundlove it it's good it's a greatexperience once you know what you'redoing it's a great experience even whenyou're not good at it right uh do youenjoy let's see do what you enjoy notnecessarily keeps you abstracted fromreal problems Fair everybody spends timein in denial it's normal as long as youare ready to come out of it afterrealization learn core G Linux toolsthis is the best piece of advice in thisentire article right here you'llunderstand the benefit in the long uhterm for example I have been much uhbetter at Rex okay bad example if I justcontinued using GP and said okay badexample don't no this is not why you doit stop it stop itum but real talk the amount of benefityou'll get from just learning thesestupid things I cannot tell you how manytimes I've seen somebody write somethingto walk a file tree guess who also wrotesomething in an interviewto write or to walk a file tree for apattern and I did it inJava I did it inJava I did it inJava Vim has search scroll plugins likeEasy Motion Vim sneak to navigate bufferyou should use them Vimgo I was I I resolved to use Vim notbecause it's any better for my specificworkflow but because I wanted to breakmy dependency on vs code I knew Icouldn't drop into Vim for my day job soI settled on the middle ground of usingVim bindings in vs code courtesy of aYouTuber called BenAwad Ben doeslove does love the vs code Vimbindings uh who showed this peacefulpath of adopting Vim I've alwayswondered how he could magically teleportto random places when I could only movethere really fast uh on the safe let'ssee on the safe side I automaticallyturn it off in all my office projectfolders nothing in Vin particularlyamazed me because I had a similarshortcuts in mind for vs code yet theconstant tussle between both was gettinghard by the end of the year I couldfluently navigate in VSS code using Vimbindings after almost a year of usage Istarted seeing the ergonomics andfunctional benefits key points bepractical you son of a gun learn to walkbefore you run Temptations okay that'sactually Fair Temptations to achievewhat others flash uh is a goodmotivationpersonal willpower won't be enough toexplore Uncharted territories we needsome Rocket Fuel to Kickstart theprocess I honestly don't even know whatthatmeans this is fair this isfair itworks itworksyou know it's hard to explain to peoplewhy Vim is so good but I feel like everytime someone gets good at a set of keybindings even if you use the emac oneI've seen someone really good at theemac one like once I which still blowsme away but he doesn't type properly andso I think the fact that emac is socrazy and his inability to type wellworked for him uh but when you seesomeone really good at what they use youunderstand you know what the power lookslike but until you felt it it's just sohard to to explain why it's sogood it's so hard to explain why it's sogood it's so hard it's impossible uh Iwas darn stupid of me to think that uhone day I'll uninstall vs code and moveto Vim someday because I could navigatethere similarly similarly I didn'trealize I was using Vim bindings fordoing vs code things the workflow partwas still a miss all that I learned wasa few keyboard shortcuts I moved anywaysone day I had to find and replace a wordin projects I couldn't do it so welcomeback home vs code at this point hadbecome my identity I couldn't flythrough code blazingly fast blazinglyfast in vs code uh and my friends knewthat uh me for that so I settled back inleaving Vim I was happy I could dowhatever those Vim nerds could do yet Iwas still in a big comfort zone bias myproblem was that I was using VSS codewith hybrid key bindings and now uhreplaced even with something else whatkind of solution was that luckily I gota break from Office Project work uhsometime back and I knew this was thechance to transition my configs Irealized I had no trouble in moving tofrom Sublime to vs code it was a happyprocess I started working in raw neovimjust Rod dogging it and yeah it waspainful but I had a plan whenever I misssomething I would re I would read neimdocs and addit TJ I could you just hear TJ TJ rightnow is crying oh my goodness this isstraight up this is TJ look at this thisis TJ makes me happy I understand andnever written every single line of myeditor conf fig took me two months andnow I have my own sweet pte personaldevelopment environment let's go te note is crying te is happier TJ has neverbeen happier in his life TJ let's goreading the docks and everything let'sgo this uh covered everything fromdefault indentation uh size to file treeto language servers earlier I watched aYouTube video from the private on Neosetup it overwhelmed me so badly that Ihad to take a week's break from thinkingabout my ownletgo let's go I do set up the entireneovim configuration in like 20 minuteseverything I did get a prime mention butI would say it was probably a littlenegative mention but still we still gotone we still got one acknowledge theiceberg Theory one gets attracted towhat floats and not uh the work it willtake to create and understand the basemy suggestion if you ask is simplerespect it 30minutes we got them my biggestmotivation for making the final switchwas a new off Factor surrounding Vim asa software all you see in thescreenshots below text terminal on theWindows no images no real buttons no gueof any kind they aren't even real iconsit's all it's really hard I imagine youcan't even change the font or the sizeof it every single thing is carefullymanipulated text on a black terminalwindow that respect for the people whobuilt it keeps megoing all right I think we're hittingthe end here Prime gen making a new Vimusers feel bad I am you're you'rewelcome I thought the video was greatokay people loved it like And subscribehey like Andsubscribe right now press the like Andsubscribe button now that I have fullymoved my workflow to newm it doesn'tfeel any different I was already usinguh used to the Vim bindings by the waythis is the best way to do it if you'regoing to learn Vim learn Vim bindingsfirst okay learn Vim bindings first it'stotally worthit it's totally worth it because thenyou don't have to fight like you don'twant to learn two things atonce learn onething learn one thing just one all rightuh exactly uh the let's see the onlyAesthetics I have change yet the goodpart is I understand how these movingpieces work I understand that the inlineerror messages shows from where theseFancy Auto completions come how eachline gets formatted and much morelooking back I could have peeped intothe source code of vs code or it'sextension but but the mindset was to useit not to learn it this is a great thisis a fantastic line by the way righthere the mindset of vs code is to use itnot learn it whereas the mindset ofneovim is to learn it then use it it isjust a little bit different it is just adifferent type of mindset the biggestshift uh is that I look at software inuh General from the mentality of abuilder rather than a consumer now whenI see something I Ponder how to build itrather than useit let's go after all I'm an engineerand my identity revolves around two mainthings how well I understand softwareand what I can build beautiful look atlook at that Beauty look at that Beautylook at that beauty you're using cursivedisgusting but whatever I'm not gonnaI'm not I'm only I'm judging I'm judgingI did Judge I judge thoroughly look atthat look at that look at that telescopelet's go telescope let's go telescopeunfortunately I can't through uh gothrough every screen in utility but ifyou'd like the setup I can write anarticle on how everything I did fromscratch okay nice uhfrequently asked questions will usingVim make me a better developer yes takethat uh I take thatguarantee Iagree I know people hate that but Iactually agree with that no Harpoonscreenshot I know sad it was sad howhard is the transition pretty easy justa few hundred keybindings it is the reason why is thatyou have to learn your environment andlearn learning your environment andlearning how things work makes the worldseem like a smaller place and a moreovercomable place and you're able tolearn things in a new way just simplybecause you've taken such a hard stepand a lot of people don't take thosehard steps very frequently in theircareer and so I think it's very verygood to take those steps and to knowthat you should do that right becauselanguage servers there's nothing reallythat crazy about itovercomable all right uh what does iteven matter it's just an editor my go uhlet's see my work goes with what I writeif you want to be an engineer or awriter uh figure it out fast uh goodthat you chose engineer now think againhow many fundamentals of engineering doyou get exposed to uh that your day jobabstracts from you you don't want to bean engineer with a weak core do you youdon't do some sit-ups sit on a ball itseems hard to uh to get started will Igrab it it took two years multiple quitsand let's see and it only worked when Istarted from scratch an incrementallyadded functionality it's your child nowyou won't say anything bad about itremember that you didn't choose yourinterests you raise interest in a thingyou put effortinto also really goodyeah to be honest I lost my USB dongletruestory poor USB dongle you know he hadthe ability to make to make Sublime editlike his on any platform and then goesand loses it did I go fishing I used tofish a lot Vim rocks hoodie comes inwhen we'll think about it ah this isgreat this this was actually a reallygood article it makes me realize likeall the things that I had to do to gothrough Vim uh mine was a little bitdifferent Journey but I did like I meanI started in net beans or I started inlike some other editors uh blue jay thennet beans uh then I tried eclips hatedeclips back to net beans tried VI hatedVI went back to net beans then from netbeans I went to in from intell I startedVim motions and then I started using Vimmotions and I got really good at Vimmotions and then from intellig I triedout Vim hated Vim went back to intelligwent to vs code sublime's been sprinkledon and off in there for so many timesfrom there I went to back to vs codethen I went to Adam realize Adam writeseverything in coffeescript went back tovs code realized I still don't like vscode retried Vim again still didn't likeit went back to intellig then eventuallyI went back to vim and then I was justusing vim and starting to like it andthen I went and started using neovim andI love it hey thename don't even try it with me the nameis the primagen
